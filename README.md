# funsies-bot
A Discord bot made using discord.py

## General Information
Current version is in private development, and the git version will be updated at some point in the future.

## Location of commands
All bot commands are found in `botfiles/myCommands.py`. `required` contains the utilities needed to make the bot run smoothly.

## Disclaimer
Funsies is still in active development, meaning that it is far from complete. Currently the bot is being developed by only one person, so it lacks proper formatting, comments, documentation, and optimization.
