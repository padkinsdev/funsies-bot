# funsies-bot
A Discord bot made using discord.py

## Location of commands
All bot commands are found in `botfiles/myCommands.py`. `required` contains the utilities needed to make the bot run smoothly.

## Disclaimer
Don't use this. Seriously. It was my first stab at creating a Discord bot, and while the final version (which this is very much not) technically works as intended, it would be best suited to being the target of a tutorial on spaghetti code and poor data storage/handling technique.
